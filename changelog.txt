# The Vision

The idea is to provide complex and balanced RPG experience with 
- extensive character progression and gearing, 
- improved world and cross-dimensional exploration, 
- thoughtful dungeon delving and looting, 
- custom mechanics, tweaks and guides, 
- challenging but rewarding environment,
while also re-thinking and extending core mechanics of the original Minecraft to provide a new look at old things. And also to continue the legacy of RAD 1 and RAD 2 modpacks. 

This was not designed as kitchen-sink modpack. Subtle sort of progression and guidance is present but sense of sandbox is maintained.

At some moments, some changes and tweaks were heavily inspired by the philosophy of old Minecraft beta versions. Purpose behind these adjustments is to slow down **some** aspects of the game (and thus the whole gameplay experience) and/or extend it's functionality deeper, making overcoming challenges feeling more rewarding. Every step should be meaningful, conscious and every decision should lead to a certain outcome. 

The aim is to cultivate a gameplay experience that is not just about reaching the end goal but about enjoying the journey itself. This design encourages players to appreciate the intricacies of the game, from resource management to the crafting of unique items.

# Changelog:

- General pack progression outlines
The content in the pack is not hard-gated behind Stages mod (*where you need to complete specific mod mechanics to unlock other options*), you're free to do (almost) everything from the start. However, some recipes will require you to travel to other dimensions or defeat certain **bosses/mobs**.  The access to the dimensions was also organized in a consecutive manner, providing a structured progression that encourages players to explore each realm thoroughly. This design choice not only adds depth and meaning to the dimensions but also helps to reduce **power creep**. 

Additionally, this approach promotes a more balanced gameplay experience, ensuring that players can enjoy the thrill of discovery without feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content available at once.
- Revamped some aspects of early game survival(health, villages, mobs, loot). This was made to slow down the beginning of the game
- a lot of recipe tweaks which involves interactions with other mods but with alternatives
- dimensional exploration is now needed for progressing further and unlock new recipes
- dimension access will be granted in a consecutive manner
- waystones are harder to craft to encourage other methods of moving around(horses, mounts, airships, ships, railroad)
