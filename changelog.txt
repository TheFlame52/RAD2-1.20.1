# Keyfeatures:

- Progression: modpack uses Game Stages mod [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages] to create progression system for player(s).
The game will adjust and react depending on stages that you have unlocked (your current progress in game). (basic example: you will (probably) not face strong mobs in the first night)

- Skills: 
	- Passive Skill tree: 
	- SkillIssue: Skills/Classes that also allow to grant and revoke access to items and/or Stats. In-depth System with Experience and Level-up Events		

- Custom Tools & Item system [_Flex mod page link_] that allows to mix-and-match various Materials to create unique variations of Items like Swords, Pickaxes, Backpacks and Armor:
	- Coating: Every Item has a single Coat slot, which generally improves the item in any way.
	- Tool leveling: With every Levelup, it gains a Trait Point, which can be used to increase Traits. The points required for a Trait is dependant on the Trait and the Material that added it.  
	- Material Compounding: Different Materials can be compounded to create a new material that is generated based on the Materials used.

- Factions:

- Mobs:
	- Champions-like mob modifiers with tiers [_Eminence mod page link_]	
	- scaling mobs difficulty based on current game stage
		
- Enchanting System overhaul:
	- 2 new Methods of enchanting: Roulette Enchanting and Matrix Enchanting
	- Enchantment Obelisks. Distributed in the world and allow to exchange Enchantments on your items
	- Curses that can also be used in a positive way
	- Library that stores Books as they are, but allows to filter them to efficiently sort your Books
	- extended methods of getting experience

- technology contraptions
	- Storage extensions
	
- magic
	- direct magic spells
	- trinkets & curious
	
- husbandry

- Dungeons, new structures, base decorating

- Dimensions
2. End

0. Overworld
-1. Undergarden

with Sub-dimensions:
- Bumblezone
- Twilight Forest
- Mining Dim
	
- Quests & coins:
	The end goal of having two type of coins is to encourage both exploration and questing.
	
	- Quest Coins are acquired ONLY from doing quests. 
	Quest Coins can be exchanged for loot crates with random outcome and for a set of specific reward. They're FINITE.
	
	- Regular Coins are acquired from trading materials.   
	That means if you have a lot of resources of one type you can exchange it to coins and then to needed resource of another type. They are FARMABLE.
